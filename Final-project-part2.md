# Final Project Part 2
## Wireframes and storyboards
The project aims to analyze global trends in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) service exports, focusing on how these exports have become a key revenue stream for underdeveloped and landlocked countries. Due to the high costs associated with exporting goods—such as manufacturing, transportation, and tariffs—many of these nations are shifting towards ICT services, which are less resource-intensive and more competitive in the international market. 

This project will explore the leading countries in ICT service exports, the major importers of these services, and the potential risks of over-dependence on foreign ICT vendors. The analysis will provide insights into how ICT can reshape economies and offer strategic advantages, while also highlighting the challenges of reliance on external service providers.

## User research and interviews
### User research: protocol

**1. Understanding the Story**
- Did you find the storyline easy to follow? If not, which parts were confusing or unclear?
- How well do you think the data supports the overall narrative?

**2. Visual Appeal & Layout**
- How do you find the design of the wireframes and storyboards? Are they visually appealing and engaging?
- Do you think the layout is intuitive, or were there areas where you got lost or needed more guidance?
- Are there too many, too few, or just the right number of visuals and data points presented?

**3. Clarity of Data Visualizations**
- Are the individual visualizations easy to understand?
- Did any of the visualizations stand out as particularly useful or not useful?
- What could be done to make the data visualizations clearer or more insightful?

**4. User Interaction & Experience**
- Did you feel engaged while going through the storyboards? Were there any moments where you lost interest?
- Were you able to interact with or interpret the data easily? What would make this experience better?

**5. Target Audience Fit**
- Do you feel like this story fits with what you would expect, given the target audience (government officials responsible for IT, everyday users of IT)?
- What additional information or context would you need to fully understand the story?

**6. Suggestions for Improvement**
- What specific feedback do you have for improving the wireframes and storyboards?
- Were there any points where you wanted more or less data?

# Final Project Part 1

## Summary
The project aims to analyze global trends in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) service exports, focusing on how these exports have become a key revenue stream for underdeveloped and landlocked countries. Due to the high costs associated with exporting goods—such as manufacturing, transportation, and tariffs—many of these nations are shifting towards ICT services, which are less resource-intensive and more competitive in the international market. 

This project will explore the leading countries in ICT service exports, the major importers of these services, and the potential risks of over-dependence on foreign ICT vendors. The analysis will provide insights into how ICT can reshape economies and offer strategic advantages, while also highlighting the challenges of reliance on external service providers.

## Data Source Documentation
For this project, I will use two primary datasets to analyze global ICT service exports:

**1. ICT Service Export Data by Country**

This dataset will be sourced from the [***World Bank***](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/country/by-country/startyear/LTST/endyear/LTST/indicator/BX-GSR-CCIS-CD), which offers comprehensive time series data on ICT service exports for 174 countries. The dataset covers export performance over approximately 30 years, though the time span may vary by country. This data will provide a historical overview of how ICT service exports have grown, identifying key trends, shifts in the market, and leading exporters globally.

**Usage:**
I will use this time series data to create a ***race bar chart*** that visualizes the export performance of various countries over time. This will offer a dynamic representation of how countries have ranked in terms of ICT exports, helping to visually demonstrate growth patterns and shifts in market dominance.

**2. ICT Import Data**

For the second dataset, I am looking to acquire ICT import data to identify which countries are importing ICT services and from whom. This dataset will allow for an analysis of the flow of ICT services across borders. I aim to find data that details the country-to-country export-import relationships.

**Usage:**
The ICT import data will be visualized using a ***Sankey diagram***, which is ideal for showing flows between countries. This visualization will help the audience observe the intricate connections between exporting and importing countries, illustrating the dependency relationships between nations in the ICT sector.

Together, these datasets will provide a complete picture of ICT service trade, showing both the export leadership of countries and the flow of services to recipient nations.

## Method and medium
For the final project, I am tentatively planning to use [***ArcGIS Story Maps***](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/) as the primary platform for documenting and presenting my analysis. While I am also considering [***Shorthand***](https://shorthand.com/), I haven't fully explored its capabilities yet. To create the visualizations, I plan to use [***Flourish Studio***](https://app.flourish.studio/projects) for the race bar chart, as it is well-suited for creating interactive visualizations. For the Sankey diagram, I will either use [***Tableau***](https://www.tableau.com/) or ***Flourish Studio*** to ensure consistency in the design and style of the visual elements

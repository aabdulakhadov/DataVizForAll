# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio with Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
My name is [Abdulaziz Abdulakhadov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aabdulakhadov/), and I’m originally from [Uzbekistan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvY0B4k5Pz8) - one of only two double-landlocked countries in the world, located in Central Asia. I am currently a second-year graduate student pursuing my Master’s in Public Policy Management and Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University.

After earning my BS in Economics with Finance from the University of Westminster in Tashkent, I worked at the E-Government Development Center for two years before joining the Ministry of Digital Technologies of the Republic of Uzbekistan. At the Ministry, I managed and coordinated IT projects in healthcare.

I have a wonderful family with four kids and a lovely, supportive wife (our youngest was born here in Pittsburgh, making her a true American!). I also have a rich database of children playgrounds with map coordinates (lol). I’m a huge fan of football (soccer), although with my studies and family responsibilities, I rarely have time to play. I also love traveling with my family and enjoy cooking on the weekends.

# What I hope to learn
I am excited to delve into the course on "Telling Stories with Data" because I am passionate about transforming complex data into compelling narratives. I hope to learn effective techniques for visualizing data, creating impactful presentations, and using storytelling to communicate insights clearly and persuasively.

## Assignment: [Visualizing government Debt](/visualizing-government-debt.md)
In this assignment, I explored and visualized government debt-to-GDP ratio data using various tools and techniques. I started with a web-based visualization from the OECD, embedding it on my portfolio. I then used Tableau to create a highlight table and a heat map, showcasing different perspectives on the debt data. Finally, I developed a custom visualization to provide a unique view of the data, focusing on clarity and effective use of color. Each visualization aims to present the data in an insightful and accessible manner, highlighting trends and disparities across countries.

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](/critique-by-design.md)
For this assignment, I selected and redesigned a data visualization from [MakeoverMonday](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/), applying a structured critique and redesign process. I started by critiquing the original visualization using Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf), identifying strengths and areas for improvement. I then sketched out redesign ideas, tested them with user feedback, and refined my approach based on this input. Finally, I built a polished solution in Tableau, aiming to enhance clarity and data communication.

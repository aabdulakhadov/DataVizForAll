# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio with Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
My name is [Abdulaziz Abdulakhadov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aabdulakhadov/), and I’m originally from [Uzbekistan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvY0B4k5Pz8) - one of only two double-landlocked countries in the world, located in Central Asia. I am currently a second-year graduate student pursuing my Master’s in Public Policy Management and Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University.

After earning my BS in Economics with Finance from the University of Westminster in Tashkent, I worked at the E-Government Development Center for two years before joining the Ministry of Digital Technologies of the Republic of Uzbekistan. At the Ministry, I managed and coordinated IT projects in healthcare.

I have a wonderful family with four kids and a lovely, supportive wife (our youngest was born here in Pittsburgh, making her a true American!). I also have a rich database of children playgrounds with map coordinates (lol). I’m a huge fan of football (soccer), although with my studies and family responsibilities, I rarely have time to play. I also love traveling with my family and enjoy cooking on the weekends.

# What I hope to learn
I am excited to delve into the course on "Telling Stories with Data" because I am passionate about transforming complex data into compelling narratives. I hope to learn effective techniques for visualizing data, creating impactful presentations, and using storytelling to communicate insights clearly and persuasively.

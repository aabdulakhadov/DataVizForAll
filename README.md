# About me
My name is [Abdulaziz Abdulakhadov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aabdulakhadov/), and I’m originally from [Uzbekistan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvY0B4k5Pz8) - one of only two double-landlocked countries in the world, located in Central Asia. I am currently a second-year graduate student pursuing my Master’s in Public Policy Management and Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University.
After earning my BS in Economics with Finance from the University of Westminster in Tashkent, I worked at the E-Government Development Center for two years before joining the Ministry of Digital Technologies of the Republic of Uzbekistan. At the Ministry, I managed and coordinated IT projects in healthcare.

# Final Project Part 3

## A final writeup

**Intended Audience and Personas**

The primary audience for this [data story](https://preview.shorthand.com/G7eSFvpFAPu4oHmy/responsive/desktop) comprises companies that engage in IT projects, specifically those considering outsourcing. This audience includes decision-makers from large, small, and mid-sized IT organizations, as well as government officials responsible for IT procurement. By tailoring the narrative to address their needs, this data story aims to provide valuable insights into current global trends in IT outsourcing, highlighting both the opportunities and risks associated with these decisions. It also emphasizes actionable recommendations for companies considering outsourcing, addressing common pitfalls and providing resources for vendor selection. This reflective process not only improved the final presentation but also deepened my understanding of the intricacies involved in creating effective data stories.

**Adjustments Based on Audience Insights**

Since completing Part II, I identified several key insights through user interviews and feedback. The audience’s need for clarity and immediate comprehension led to significant changes in how I presented the data. Inspired by a classmate’s work, I switched the original bar chart displaying developers' average salaries across different countries to a unit chart. This unit chart effectively demonstrates how many developers can be hired in each country based on the average salary of Indian developers, making the information more visually clear and easier to understand.

**Design Decisions and Lessons Learned**

Throughout this process, I made various design decisions to enhance user engagement and comprehension. For instance, incorporating a world map highlighted the global context of IT outsourcing, making the story more visually appealing and informative. Additionally, I revised the title to better reflect the overarching theme of IT dependencies and added IT-related images to enhance visual appeal. Even though Shorthand offers many features, such as effects, ready templates, and scrollmation for building a data story, the power of well-crafted data visualizations remains crucial. A strong visualization can convey the story effectively and succinctly, allowing the audience to grasp the key messages without overwhelming them with unnecessary details. Ultimately, the blend of effective visualization and thoughtful design choices enhances the overall narrative and engages the audience more deeply.

One key takeaway from this journey has been the importance of audience feedback in shaping the final output. The insights gained from the interviews helped narrow my focus and reinforced the need for clarity in visualizations. If I had more time, I would have conducted additional user interviews, as creators of data stories can often overlook points that could enhance the visualizations. Being too familiar with the material can lead to missed opportunities for improvement, as one's eyes become accustomed to the presentation.
